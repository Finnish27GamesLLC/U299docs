ULTIMA299.BAS loads data saved by ULTIMA282.BAS about playing strategy.
ULTIMA299.BAS loads data saved by ULTIMA298.BAS about average stack compositions
that occur at various card count totals during a simulated game of blackjack
and generates indices. ULTIMA297.BAS loads and uses these indices to vary
player response strategy with changes in the integer card count total during
a simulated game of blackjack. ULTIMA298.BAS stores the number of times bets
were placed at the various integer card count totals that occurs during 
a simulated a game of blackjack. ULTIMA298.BAS also stores data about stack
compositions that occur at the time a bet was placed at those various integer
card count totals that occur during simulated play of a game of blackjack.
The average stack composition that occurred at any given card count total
can be found by dividing the sum of all stack compositions found at a given
integer card count total by the sum of all the times bets were placed at
that card count total. ULTIMA299.BAS loads this data saved by ULTIMA298.BAS
about the various integer card count totals that occurred during
a simulated game of blackjack and about the average stack compositions
that correlate with those various integer card count totals and does
an approximate combinatorial analysis to find a nearly optimal
combination dependent playing strategy for each of the average stack
compositions that occured at each of the various integer card count levels.
This approximate combinatorial analysis of average deck compositions
is the basis for the playing indices used by ULTIMA297.BAS to
vary playing strategy with changes in the integer card count total
during a user defined simulated game of blackjack. These three programs
when used together offer a way of creating and testing playing indices
for a user defined card count strategy in a simulated game of blackjack.
